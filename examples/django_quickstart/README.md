### Introduction

**Who is this for?**

This is intended for a lazy as f@$k, programmer who just wants to get up and running with the Django framework. You can use this to make sure you have checked the important boxes.

I have written this also, because, I think the official documentation gets into a so much crap before one has even gotten a grasp of what the framework really is. Â¯\(Â°\_o)/Â¯


**How long is gonna take me?**

Suprise me! ðŸ™ˆ 

**What awesome thing are we building now?**

A polling app - like on the [officical documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/).

See [demo](https://[django_quickstart].herokuapp.com).

### Installation 

Before you start

- [ ] Install python3 
- [ ] Install pip3
- [ ] [optional], Simply, install [virtualenvwrapper](https://medium.com/the-andela-way/configuring-python-environment-with-virtualenvwrapper-8745c2895745) and stop swearing so damn much.

Installing Django

- [ ] Use pip to install Django.
- [ ] Use `pip freeze` to populate `requirements.txt` file. 

### Prepping the Database

> **Heads up!** An app is a Web application that does something â€“ e.g., a Weblog system, a database of public records or a small poll app. A project is a collection of configuration and apps for a particular website. A project can contain multiple apps. An app can be in multiple projects.
