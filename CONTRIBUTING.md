# Contributing guidelines

We request contributors to adhere to to the following guidelines: 

- Open an issue to report a problem or propose a new guide.
- Please make an individual pull request to address a single, clearly defined issue.
- Submit PRs within the first few commits so that everyone is aware of the direction you're taking.
- Make sure there is no trailing whitespace.
