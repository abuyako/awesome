# Contributing Guidelines

Please ensure your pull request adhere to to the following guidelines:

- Open an issue to report a problem or propose a new guide.
- Please make an individual pull request to address a single, a clearly defined issue.
- Submit PRs within the first few commits so that everyone is aware of the direction you're taking.
- Make sure there is no trailing whitespace.

- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Suggested packages should be tested and documented.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Use the following format: [PACKAGE](LINK) - DESCRIPTION.
- New categories, or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive.
- End all descriptions with a full stop/period.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.

Thank you for your suggestions!
