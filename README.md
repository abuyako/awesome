# A Style Guide

This is a project for documenting standards for writing code.

> Part of being a good steward to a successful project is realizing that
> writing code for yourself is a Bad Ideaâ„¢. If thousands of people are using
> your code, then write your code for maximum clarity, not your personal
> preference of how to get clever within the spec. - Idan Gazit
