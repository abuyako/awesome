# A Style Guide

Style Guide is project for documenting standards for writing code. 

## 1. General principles

> "Part of being a good steward to a successful project is realizing that
> writing code for yourself is a Bad Ideaâ„¢. If thousands of people are using
> your code, then write your code for maximum clarity, not your personal
> preference of how to get clever within the spec." - Idan Gazit

* Don't try to prematurely optimize your code; keep it readable and
  understandable.
* All code in any code-base should look like a single person typed it, even
  when many people are contributing to it.
* Strictly enforce the agreed-upon style.
* If in doubt when deciding upon a style use existing, common patterns.

## 2. Whitespace

Only one style should exist across the entire source of your code-base. Always
be consistent in your use of whitespace. Use whitespace to improve
readability.

* _Never_ mix spaces and tabs for indentation.
* Choose between soft indents (spaces) or real tabs. Stick to your choice
  without fail. (Preference: spaces)
* If using spaces, choose the number of characters used per indentation level.
  (Preference: 4 spaces)

Tip: configure your editor to "show invisibles" or to automatically remove
end-of-line whitespace.

Tip: use an [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/) file (or equivalent) to
help maintain the basic whitespace conventions that have been agreed for your
code-base.

## 3. Comments

Well commented code is extremely important. Take time to describe components,
how they work, their limitations, and the way they are constructed. Don't leave
others in the team guessing as to the purpose of uncommon or non-obvious
code.

Comment style should be simple and consistent within a single code base.

* Place comments on a new line above their subject.
* Use "sentence case" comments and consistent text indentation.

Example:

```css
/**
 * Short description using Doxygen-style comment format
 *
 * The first sentence of the long description starts here and continues on this
 * line for a while finally concluding here at the end of this paragraph.
 *
 * The long description is ideal for more detailed explanations and
 * documentation. It can include example HTML, URLs, or any other information
 * that is deemed necessary or useful.
 *
 * @tag This is a tag named 'tag'
 *
 * TODO: This is a todo statement that describes an atomic task to be completed
 *   at a later date. It wraps after 80 characters and following lines are
 *   indented by 2 spaces.
